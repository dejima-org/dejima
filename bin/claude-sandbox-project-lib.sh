# Two kinds of file are involved and they are NOT equally trusted:
#
#   .claude-sandbox/{allowed-domains,dependencies} in the project - a
#   DECLARATION. The project directory is bind-mounted read-write, so a
#   compromised session can write these. They grant nothing; they are read
#   only to compare against reality and suggest a command for the user to
#   run. Parsed, never sourced - same reason bin/claude-sandbox-env.sh
#   refuses to source config/env.
#
#   ~/.config/claude-sandbox/projects/<slug>/* - an APPROVAL. Written only
#   by the CLIs, which only the user runs, and never mounted into the
#   container. This is the only thing that actually grants anything.
